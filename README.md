# Secure API Gateway with JWT Validation

## 📌 Project Summary

The **Secure API Gateway** project is designed to enforce robust **authentication**, **authorization**, **rate limiting**, and **secure traffic forwarding** for your microservices architecture. It provides a single entry point to your backend APIs with multiple security layers.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a secure API gateway to:
- ✅ Validate JWTs with **role-based access control**.
- ✅ Apply **IP throttling** using **Redis**.
- ✅ Log **requests & responses** with timestamps for auditing.
- ✅ Offload TLS and enforce **HTTPS** (self-signed certificate).
- ✅ Detect abuse and send alerts.
- ✅ Provide a **dashboard** for monitoring API usage and system health.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend:** React.js (MUI)
- **Security:** JWT, OAuth2 (extension, optional)
- **Rate Limiting:** Redis
- **Web Server:** Linux, SystemD, Nginx (for TLS offloading)
- **Monitoring:** Dashboard with logs & alert system
